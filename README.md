# Adobe India Hackathon: Connecting the Dots

This repository contains the complete submission for Round 1 of the Adobe India Hackathon by Team "Adobe Lelo Pls". Our project tackles the challenge of reimagining the PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience.

## Project Overview

In a world flooded with documents, what wins is not more contentâ€”it's context. Our mission for this hackathon was to build the foundational tools for a future where documents understand their own structure and can intelligently surface the most relevant information based on a user's specific needs.

This repository is divided into two main solutions, corresponding to the two challenges in Round 1:

### Challenge 1A: Structured Outline Extraction

A system that parses any PDF and accurately extracts its hierarchical structure (Title, H1, H2, H3).

View the detailed solution in [/challenge_1a](/challenge_1a)

### Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

An intelligent analyst that reads a collection of documents and prioritizes the most relevant sections based on a specific user persona and their "job-to-be-done."
